    <p>TwentyOne is a card game in which a player tries to get closer to 21 than the house
       (or dealer) does.  Typically, twentyone is favorable to the player if skill is used
       in playing the game (or card counting!).  This version of TwentyOne includes a sub-set
	   of the BlackJack rules (Splits, Insurance, Double Down).</p>
	<p>To start a hand, press the 'play' button.  After entering your bet, cards are dealt,
       two to dealer and two to the player.  The first dealer card is face down when 
       initially dealt.  If neither have 21 to start, the other buttons become (may
       become) enabled.</p>
    <p>To get an additional card, press the hit button.  If you go over 21, you lose.
       To stand on your cards, press the stay button.  The dealer will then finish out
       the dealer hand.</p>
    <p>If both of your cards are the same, you can split your hand.  Note, you must have
       enough money in your bank to cover the split hand and each hand will get one
       card (and only one card).  This is different than some of the rules, but leads to
       an easier game.</p>
    <p>If you have not taken any hits, you can double your bet (the button is not available
       if you have taken a hit.  When selected, you must have enough money in your bank
       to cover the double-down.  If you do, you are given one additional card and then the
       dealer plays out.  If you go over 21 with the additional card, you lose.</p>
	<p>If the dealer has an ace showing, you are given the opportunity to buy insurance.
       Insurance costs 25% of your bet (you must have enough money to cover the amount in
       your bank) and if the dealer has 21, you will get back 75% of your bet.  If you don't
       buy insurance, the hand is played through like normal (even if the dealer has 21).</p>
    <p>If you don't have enough money (at the beginning of the hand) to cover the current
       minimum bet amount, a prompt will ask you if you wish to reset the game (and give you,
       the player) the initial bank again (plus whatever is currently in your bank, if 
       anything).</p>
    <p>This game is not intended to follow each and every little esoteric rule of TwentyOne that
       some may know of, but it tries to be close.  This game is not intended for (nor
       designed for) actual betting or gambling.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">In summary, the rules followed by this game are as follows:</div>
	<ul>
	  <li>Dealer hits on 16 or less, stays on 17+.
      <li>Splits will play hitting one card on each one.
      <li>Double can only be done at the start of a hand and will hit one card.
      <li>Insurance can be bought when the dealer has an ace showing.
          (costs 25% of bet (1 dollar bets cost nothing))
      <li>If player or dealer hit to 5 cards without going over 21, they
          are the automatic winner.
      <li>If dealer or player has twentyone to start, they are the winner
          (unless insurance can be bought or both have 21).
      <li>Closest to 21 without going over is the winner.
	  <li>If both dealer and player have same score, it is a push and bet is refunded.
	</ul>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>TwentyOne has many, and varied, options.  The options dialog is accessed by selecting
       the 'options' button in the main window.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of Decks: Select one to seven decks to play with.  The number of decks,
          if changed, takes affect with the next shuffle.  The more decks used, the harder
		  it is to do card counting.  For most play, one to three decks in the card shoe
		  should be enough.  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: one.</div>
      <li>Minimum Bet: Minimum amount to bet (in whole amounts only).  Can be from 1 to
          10000.  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: $1.00.</div>
      <li>Maximum Bet: Maximum amount to bet (in whole amounts only).  Can be from minimum bet
          to 10000.  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: $5.00.</div>
      <li>Initial Bank: Amount of money player is given at the game start or with each
          reset (in whole amounts only).  Can be from minimum bet to 100000.
		  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: $100.00.</div>
	  <li>Bet Max: If checked, sets the maximum (or as much money as player has) in the
          bet dialog rather than the miniumum bet amount.  This option is more of an convenience
		  option for those that want to bet the max with each hand without having to set it.
		  If not checked, the bet dialog is seeded with the minimum bet amount.
		  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: Off</div>
	  <li>The card back area contains a list of card backs available to the game.  The current
          card back is selected in the list and displayed to the right.  To select a different
		  card back image, select the appropriate image name in the drop down.  The image to the
		  right is updated with the current selection.
		  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Default: First image in list.</div>
    </ul>
	<p>Pressing OK saves (and changes) your game options, pressing cancel keeps your
       current settings.</p>
